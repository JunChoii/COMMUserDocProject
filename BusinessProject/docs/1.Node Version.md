To use [Fetch](#fetch) API, you need to make sure your [Node.js](#nodejs) version is up to date.

### 1. Checking your [Node.js](#nodejs) version in the terminal

#### Open the terminal on your [VS Code](#vscode) or other platform and type run the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

The output should look like this:

If the version retrieved by the code is under than the version **v18.0.0** means that you need to update your [Node.js](#nodejs) version to run the [Fetch](#fetch) API, for the particular reason that the [Fetch](#fetch) API functionality was only natively implemented in [Node.js](#nodejs) in 2015 in that version, so you need the version  **v18.0.0** or above.

### 2. Update your [Node.js](#nodejs) version to the latest version or the latest stable version if needed

Choose one of the options of code below and in your terminal type and run one of the following code for the [Node.js](#nodejs) version that you want:

#### latest stable version

```bash
npm i node@latest
```

#### latest version

```bash
npm i node@lts
```

After this you should have the stable or the latest version of [Node.js](#nodejs) running on your computer.

## Conclusion
In order to utilize the Fetch API in your project, make sure your Node.js version is current. Use 'node -v' to see your current version. Update Node.js to the most recent stable version ('npm i node@latest') or the most recent LTS version ('npm i node@lts') if it is below v18.0.0.

Once Node.js has been upgraded, you can utilize the Fetch API without encountering compatibility problems, allowing for excellent data management and efficient network queries in your Node.js apps.
