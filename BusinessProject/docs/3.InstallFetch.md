# 3. Installing Fetch

To install the Fetch API is simple. Using the npm library, utilize the following code in your terminal to install all the node modules necessary to run code that involves the node fetch application:

```bash
npm install node-fetch
```

## Conclusion

The Fetch API is a powerful tool for fetching resources and submitting data in modern web applications. With its flexibility and support for Promises, it's a great alternative to the older XMLHttpRequest method. By installing the necessary dependencies and packages, such as node-fetch, you can easily start using the Fetch API in your Node.js projects.

Remember to always keep your packages and dependencies up-to-date to ensure your code is secure and efficient.
